# hello-world
My first git hub repository

Hi my name is DaiWei Rao this is my first GitHub repository and this account would mostly likely be my job profile that I would like to show it to companies of the work that I have done.

In here I would like to show the set of skill I have acquire through this journey and my passion about improving as a individual to obtain knowledge and skills that not many will put their time and effort in.
And to show my value to the companies and make sure that I am worth of them paying me the salary they pay.
